😊 Emotion Detector AI
Emotion Detector AI is a machine learning–based application that analyzes facial expressions to detect human emotions in real time. The project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision and deep learning for emotion recognition from images or live video input.

🚀 Features
Detects human emotions from facial expressions
Supports multiple emotion classes (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprised)
Uses a trained deep learning model for accurate prediction
Can work with static images or real-time webcam input
Lightweight and easy to run locally

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

🧠 How It Works
Captures an image or video frame
Detects the face using computer vision techniques
Preprocesses the face region
Passes the data to a trained CNN model
Predicts and displays the detected emotion

🎯 Use Cases
Human–computer interaction
Mental health and mood analysis
Emotion-aware applications
Educational projects in AI & computer vision

🌱 Future Enhancements
Improve accuracy with a larger dataset
Add real-time emotion tracking dashboard
Deploy as a web application
Support more emotion categories
